# 1
- this data shows how a derived class method can override a base class method
- Notice the derived class methods have the same names, and the same argument and return types, as the base class methods
- When the same method exists in both the base class and the derived class, the method in the derived class will be executed.

# 2
- the derived class method is calling the base class method using the scope reolution (::) operator
- notice that the derived class has added in some (boundry) modifications in it's override method
