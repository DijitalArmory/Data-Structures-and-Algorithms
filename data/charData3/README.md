- this data shows how to initialize data members through the constructor's parameters
- this is a more preferred way of doing things in general
- notice how the set method is eliminated when doing it this way
- notice how the data member's values are passed into the class object as arguments, in the main function

- Destructors are also used in classes
- Like constructors, destructors do not have a return value. They also take no arguments (the assumption being that there’s only one way to destroy an object) The most common use of destructors is to deallocate memory that was allocated for the object by the constructor. We’ll investigate destructors later when doing pointers. Until then we won’t have much use for destructors.
