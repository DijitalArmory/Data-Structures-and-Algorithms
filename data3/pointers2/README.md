* pointer
- A variable that holds an address value is called a pointer variable, or simply a pointer

- notice that assigning a pointer to a variable using the 'address of' operator. 
- notice that to get the value (of the variable pointed to) through the pointer, the same (*) symbol is used on on the pointer. This is called dereferencing.
