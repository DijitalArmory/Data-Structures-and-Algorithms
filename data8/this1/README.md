* This Pointer
- This data shows the meaning of the 'this' pointer

* From the book "Object Oriented C++"
- The member functions of every object have access to a sort of magic pointer named this,
which points to the object itself. Thus any member function can find out the address of the
object of which it is a member

- notice how the 'this' pointer can access it's object's data
